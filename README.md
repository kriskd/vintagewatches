Bruce's Vintage Watches
=======================

This is a pro bono website re-write project built in CakePHP.

The Cake Config folder is submodule kept in a private repository to keep
senstive passwords, etc out of the public github repo.

If you are collaborating with me you will need the submodule after cloning
the main project.  Get the submodule with:
`git submodule add ssh://cakeconfig@sofia.dreamhost.com/home/cakeconfig/cakeconfig.dreamhosters.com/watchstore-config.git Config`
There will be a password prompt to get this private repo that I will provide.

The previous version of the project https://github.com/kriskd/thewatchstore
will likely be going away.
